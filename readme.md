This repository is meant for reproducibility and extensibility of the paper *On the impossibility of non-trivial accuracy in presence of fairness constraints*.

The repository contains two main notebooks that you can open right away:

1. [`Algorithm_1_and_figures.ipynb`](https://github.com/caph1993/impossibility-fairness-non-trivial-accuracy/blob/master/Algorithm_1_and_figures.ipynb)
2. [`Algorithm_2_and_figures.ipynb`](https://github.com/caph1993/impossibility-fairness-non-trivial-accuracy/blob/master/Algorithm_2_and_figures.ipynb)

Please refer to the paper for understanding all the implementation details.
